## Process

This tool runs automatically and will file policy issues in here, labeled with
`area-violation` and with the particular policy (e.g. `PR01`) and assign it to
the appropriate user:

* For org issues, it will assign the org owners.
* For repo issues, it will assign the repo admins. If there are no admins, it
  will assign the org owners.
* For team issues, it will assign the maintainers. If there are no maintainers,
  it will assign the org owners.
* For issues with a specific user account, it will assign the user.

If an issue already exists but was closed, it will reopen the issue. If the
assignees believe the policy violation is necessary, they should loop in the
[@policy-cops] team.

When consensus is reached that the violation is acceptable, the [@policy-cops]
will label the issue `policy-override` and close it. The tool will not reopen
such issues.

## Policy modification

If you think new polices are needed or policies should be changed, file an
issue.
